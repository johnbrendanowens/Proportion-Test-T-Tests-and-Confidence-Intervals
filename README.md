# Proportion-Test-T-Tests-and-Confidence-Intervals
This is a homework I did in the Spring 2017. It involves conducting proportions tests, one sample t-test, two sample t-tests, paired t-tests, non-parametic Wilcoxon tests, and creating confidence intervals. It has problem numbers that associated to problems in "Using R: Introductory Statistics".
